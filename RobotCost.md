## Cost Components
We were given a budget of $100 to spend on our robot. The following are all the parts used on our robot that
contribute towards the total cost:

### Lab provided parts

4 Line (grayscale) sensors: $3 each = $12
3 IR distance sensors: $7 each = $21
1 Electret Microphone Amplifier: $7 each = $7
2 Parallax servos: $13 = $26
1 LM358 OPAMP $0.48 = $0.48

### Purchased parts
[1 Adafruit Pro Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2000) - 5V 16MHz: $9.95 + $2 shipping = $11.95 

(Dan bought this in a bigger order. Canâ€™t find receipt, but a link to the part is below)

All of the other parts used on our robot, such as 3-D printed plastic components and breadboards, did not contribute towards the cost, and are therefore free. The total cost of our robot is $78.43.
